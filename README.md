# MovieSite

This 2 page angular app represents a movie watching web page.

This can be run on Node.js.

First run 'npm install' to install necessary packages.
Then run 'Grunt serve' to run the connect server. The application would be hosted on localhost:9000

The first page (#/index) represents an index page with carousel. The carousel has been done using Bootstrap.

Clicking on the main logo takes user to index page.

When clicked on the top right hand 'burger' icon, it takes to the tvshows page (#/tvshows).

When clicked on a TV show title, it shows the list of episodes. This modal window has been created using ui-bootstrap library.

When clicked on the 'down arrow' next to an episode, it shows the description. (Due to no suitable 'up' arrow was provided, the icon is not changed here)
